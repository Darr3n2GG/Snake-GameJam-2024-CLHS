[U-boats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-boat) will sink the Convoy in one hit; while checkpoints will increase its size by 1. U-boats appear and disappear from the map every 3 seconds, they will still cause damage when invisible. 


### Settings

Throttle the speed by pressing the comma (",") key for decreasing and the period/fullstop (".") key for increasing. The speed increases/decreases in increments of 10.

Teleportation is disabled by default but can be enabled by uncommenting code in the file.
