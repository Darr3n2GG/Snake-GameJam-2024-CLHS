# The Convoy

  You are the convoy commodore of the Convoy, who is tasked with escorting merchant ships. Your mission is simple yet challenging: reach as many checkpoints as possible and evade U-boats, which will inflict damage on the convoy. Godspeed.



## Instructions

### Controls

### Mechanics

|------|-------------|
| üü© Green    | The Convoy   |
| ‚¨úÔ∏è White    | Checkpoint  |
| üü• Red   | U-boat  |

[U-boats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-boat) will reduce the health of the Convoy, which is represented by its length, by 1; while checkpoints will increase its health by 1. Colliding with the edge of the map will teleport the Convoy to the other side. U-boats only appear on the map for 2 seconds every 5 seconds, they will still cause damage when invisible.


### Settings

Throttle the speed by pressing the comma (",") key for decreasing and the period/fullstop (".") key for increasing. The speed increases/decreases in increments of 10.
